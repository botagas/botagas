### 🎼 About Me

I’m a curious soul who loves to explore the bridge between **music and technology**.

- 🎓 Wrapping up my master’s in **Music Educology**
- 🎷 I compose and release music on **Spotify / Apple Music / SoundCloud** – links below!
- 🛠️ I’m all about self-hosting, automation, and experimenting with **Proxmox, Yunohost, Docker** and more.
- 💻 I don't consider myself a developer—but with tools like **VS Code** and **GitHub** with Copilot support, I’ve been contributing much more actively.
- 🌐 Passionate about open source and contributing where I can and what I can. Love learning more about networking and system administration.
- ☕ I run on matcha and cozy vibes.
